You are given a table, Functions, containing two columns: X and Y.



Two pairs (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2) are said to be symmetric pairs if X1 = Y2 and X2 = Y1.

Write a query to output all such symmetric pairs in ascending order by the value of X. List the rows such that X1 â‰¤ Y1.

20 20
20 21
22 23

#SOLUTION:

SELECT X, Y FROM (
SELECT X, Y FROM Functions WHERE X=Y GROUP BY X, Y HAVING COUNT(*)=2
UNION
SELECT f1.X, f1.Y FROM Functions f1, Functions f2 
WHERE f1.X < f1.Y 
AND f1.X=f2.Y 
AND f2.X=f1.Y
)t
ORDER BY X, Y;
