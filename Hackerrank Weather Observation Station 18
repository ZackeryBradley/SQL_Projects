Consider  and  to be two points on a 2D plane.

 happens to equal the minimum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
 happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
 happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
 happens to equal the maximum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
Query the Manhattan Distance between points  and  and round it to a scale of 4 decimal places.

Input Format

The STATION table is described as follows:

Station.jpg

where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.

#SOLUTION:

select round(max(lat_n) - min(lat_n) + max(long_W)-  min(long_w), 4)
from station
