A median is defined as a number separating the higher half of a data set from the lower half. Query the median of the Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION and round your answer to  4 decimal places.

Input Format

The STATION table is described as follows:

where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.


#SOLUTION:

SELECT ROUND(S1.LAT_N, 4) 
    FROM STATION AS S1 
    WHERE (SELECT ROUND(COUNT(S1.ID)/2) - 1 
           FROM STATION) = 
          (SELECT COUNT(S2.ID) 
           FROM STATION AS S2 
           WHERE S2.LAT_N > S1.LAT_N);
